# OIBSIP-TASK-4
Email Spam Detection using Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm

This repository contains code and resources for implementing a machine learning model to detect email spam using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on the text content.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of labeled emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset includes the text content of the emails, which will be used as features for training the model. This dataset is commonly used in the field of email spam detection and provides a good basis for training and evaluating the model.

Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-lear
